## Homer

Homer was a renowned ancient Greek epic poet who is believed to have written the Iliad and the Odyssey, two of the most famous and important epics in Western literature. While much about Homer's life remains unknown, it is believed that he was born sometime around 750 BC in Asia Minor (now Turkey) and that he lived until around 650 BC.

The Iliad is an epic poem that tells the story of the Trojan War, while the Odyssey tells the story of Odysseus' long journey home after the war. Both poems are highly praised for their powerful storytelling, vivid characters, and poetic language. Homer's work has been an enormous influence on subsequent Western literature, and his poems are still read and studied today.

#  Why is he considered one of the most influential filmmakers of our time?

A filmmaker is someone who makes films. This may sound simple, but there is a lot more to it than just pointing a camera and pressing record. A great film demands vision, creativity, artistry, and technical skill. It also requires the ability to tell a story that engages and entertains audiences.

There are few filmmakers who can lay claim to being truly influential. One of them is Steven Spielberg.

Spielberg’s career spans more than 40 years and he has made some of the most iconic and successful films of all time. He has won three Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, seven BAFTA Awards, and was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1999. In 2015, Spielberg was inducted into the American Film Institute’s Directing Hall of Fame.

So why is he considered one of the most influential filmmakers of our time?

Well, aside from his incredible body of work, Spielberg has also been a trailblazer in terms of technology and how films are made. He was one of the first directors to embrace computer-generated imagery (CGI) and use it to bring his stories to life on the big screen. This led to him pioneering new methods for making movies and changing the way Hollywood does business.

Spielberg is also known for his strong storytelling skills which have resulted in some truly memorable films that have resonated with audiences around the world. His ability to create emotionally compelling characters and powerful narratives has inspired other filmmakers and helped shape the way movies are made today.
