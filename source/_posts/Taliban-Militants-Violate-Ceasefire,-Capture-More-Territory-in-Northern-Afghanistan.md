#  Taliban Militants Violate Ceasefire, Capture More Territory in Northern Afghanistan

Taliban militants have resumed hostilities in northern Afghanistan, violating a ceasefire agreement and capturing more territory from the Afghan government.

The militants have seized control of two districts in Kunduz province, after clashes with Afghan security forces that left at least 30 people dead. The districts – Dasht-i-Archi and Khwaja Ghar – are both located close to the border with Tajikistan.

This latest escalation in violence highlights the continuing instability and security challenges faced by the Afghan government, despite recent efforts to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with the Taliban.

Since 2016, the Taliban has made significant territorial gains in northern Afghanistan, capturing large swathes of territory from the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). The group now controls or contests more than 40% of Afghan territory.

The Taliban’s gains in northern Afghanistan have alarmed neighboring countries, including Tajikistan, which shares a porous border with the country. In November 2018, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon traveled to Kabul for talks with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani aimed at enhancing regional security cooperation.

Despite these efforts, the Taliban has continued to make advances, raising fears that the group may soon gain control of key strategic areas in northern Afghanistan. This could potentially pave the way for increased cross-border operations by the Taliban into Tajikistan and other Central Asian countries.

#  Taliban intensify attacks as Afghan government's peace offer rejected

As the Afghan government's latest peace offer was rejected by the Taliban, the latter has intensified its attacks across the country.

On Sunday, a Taliban suicide bomber killed at least 26 people and injured scores of others in an attack on a military academy in Kabul. The attack came a day after the Taliban killed at least 20 security forces in an ambush in western Afghanistan.

This comes as the Afghan government has been making efforts to restart talks with the Taliban. On Sunday, President Ashraf Ghani offered to extend full amnesty to all Taliban fighters who renounce violence and cut ties with international terrorist groups.

The Taliban, however, said that it would not hold peace talks with the Afghan government until all foreign troops are withdrawn from Afghanistan. The group also reiterated its demand for direct talks with the United States.

The intensifying violence highlights the challenges facing the Afghan government as it seeks to reach a peace agreement with the Taliban. The resurgent militant group has been stepping up its attacks in recent months, inflicting heavy casualties on both Afghan security forces and civilians.

#  Fresh fighting reported in northern Afghanistan as ceasefire ends

Fresh clashes erupted Saturday in northern Afghanistan, officials said, after the government's ceasefire with Taliban insurgents ended.

The fighting came as the resurgent militant group has stepped up its attacks in recent weeks, seizing two provincial capitals and dozens of villages across the country.

"Clashes have resumed in Shirin Tagab district of Faryab province after the Taliban violated the ceasefire," Mohammad Mohaqiq, a deputy minister for rural development, told AFP.

Provincial police spokesman Jaweed Basharat confirmed the clash and said reinforcements had been sent to the area.

There was no immediate comment from the Taliban.

In May, the government announced a week-long ceasefire with the Taliban during Eid ul-Fitr holidays, which militants largely respected. However sporadic violence continued in some areas.

President Ashraf Ghani extended his unilateral ceasefire for another 10 days in June, but it was eventually terminated on Thursday.

#  Taliban capture two districts in Afghanistan's Kunduz province

The Taliban have captured two districts in Afghanistan's Kunduz province, a district official said on Thursday.

"The Taliban managed to take control of the districts of Imam Sahib and Aliabad overnight," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

District governor Mohammad Yusuf Ayubi and his intelligence chief were both killed in the fighting, the official added.

The Taliban confirmed they had seized control of the two districts. "We have completely cleansed these areas from puppets and their hirelings," spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.

Afghan forces backed by U.S. airstrikes have been battling to push back the Taliban since they seized Kunduz city - the provincial capital - in late September, marking their biggest victory since being ousted from power by U.S.-led forces in late 2001.

#  Civilians Suffer as Battles Rage Between Afghan Forces and Taliban

As the Afghan government and Taliban militants battle for control of the country, civilians are increasingly caught in the crossfire. According to UN figures, over 1,500 civilians were killed or injured in the first six months of 2018, with the majority wounded or killed as a result of attacks by anti-government forces.

The situation has deteriorated rapidly in recent months, with the Taliban now controlling or contesting control of more than half of Afghanistan’s districts. The war is also taking an economic toll, with an estimated $4 billion lost in GDP in 2017. This is having a devastating impact on ordinary Afghans, who are struggling to make ends meet in the face of rising prices and dwindling opportunities.

The international community has a moral responsibility to help protect Afghan civilians from harm. The United States and other NATO members must do more to support Afghan security forces so they can reclaim territory from the Taliban and ensure that those living in affected areas can safely go about their lives.
