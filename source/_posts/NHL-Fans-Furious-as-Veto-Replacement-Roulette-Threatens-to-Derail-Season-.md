#  NHL Fans Furious as Veto Replacement Roulette Threatens to Derail Season 

It was only a few short months ago that the NHL and its fans were celebrating one of the most exciting Stanley Cup Finals in recent memory. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Nashville Predators pushed each other to the brink, trading blows in a seven-game series that had everything: goals, saves, hits, and drama.

Fast forward to the present, and things are looking decidedly less rosy. The NHL preseason is underway, but preparations for the upcoming season have been disrupted by a wage dispute between team owners and players. The sticking point is Article 24.7 of the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which allows owners to opt out of the agreement after the 2017-2018 season.

The NHL Players’ Association (NHLPA) wants guarantees that the article won’t be used as a trojan horse to renege on contract commitments; team owners are balking at those demands. As a result, there’s been no progress in negotiations, with both sides seemingly entrenched in their positions.

The specter of another lockout looms over the league, with some fans already threatening to boycott this season if it comes to fruition. That would be a big mistake; as much as fans may dislike billionaire owners squeezing every penny they can out of players, hockey is still far too entertaining a sport to give up on completely.

However, team owners and players alike need to realize that they’re playing with fire here. A protracted lockout would not only cost players millions in salary, but also billions in revenue for the league. Fans are an important part of hockey’s ecosystem, and they need to be taken into account if both sides want to avoid another work stoppage.

#  What was the Point of Hasek? Roulette Replacement Strategy Fails in NHL 

In 1997-1998, the Stanley Cup was won by the Detroit Red Wings. The team’s Czech goaltender, Dominik Hasek, played a significant role in their Championship run.

Hasek was considered one of the best goaltenders in the NHL throughout his career. He won the Vezina Trophy six times and was a two-time Hart Trophy winner as the league’s most valuable player. He also helped lead the Czech Republic to a Gold Medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics.

Despite his impressive resume, there is one infamous moment during his career that stands out above all others. In game five of the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals, the Red Wings were leading 3-2 in the series and were one win away from capturing their second consecutive championship. However, Hasek allowed three goals on just nine shots before being pulled from the game. The Los Angeles Kings would go on to win game six and capture the Stanley Cup.

This moment is often cited as evidence that Hasek was not always clutch when it mattered most. However, there is another explanation for his performance in game five – one that has nothing to do with Hasek’s ability as a goaltender.

The point of Dominik Hasek was never really about his play in goal; it was always about roulette. 
Back in 2001, while Hasek was still playing for the Buffalo Sabres, VG Magazine published an article called “Dominik Hasek: The Human Roulette Wheel”. The article explained how Hasek utilized a unique goaltending style that relied heavily on chance and luck. Rather than trying to make saves by reading the play and positioning himself accordingly, he would instead wait until the last possible second before making his move. This strategy often resulted in spectacular saves – but it was also extremely risky, as it left him susceptible to higher numbers of scoring chances against.

The article highlighted how Hasek’s style could be used to generate profits at roulette tables by betting on red or black when the ball landed on a number with which he was comfortable (i.e., a number that he had previously saved while playing goalie). Given that red came up more often than black at traditional European roulette tables, this strategy would have resulted in profits over time if used correctly. 

It’s worth noting that this strategy would not work at American roulette tables – where there are 38 numbers (including both red and black), rather than 37 like in traditional European games. This is because one of the green pockets (0) pays out twice as much as any other number (x35 versus x17), which means that players will break even over time if they bet evenly on red and black. 


When Detroit signed Hasek prior to the 1997-1998 season, they did so knowing about his unique goaltending style and its potential implications for gambling profits (or losses). In fact, Red Wings General Manager Ken Holland actually flew down to meet with VG Magazine editors prior to signing Hasek, in order to learn more about his unique playing style. 

So why did Detroit bother signing him if they knew about his potential weaknesses? The answer lies in Holland’s understanding of how psychology affects sports outcomes. He knew that opposing teams would see footage of Hasek making miraculous saves and would begin to doubt their ability to score against him – even if he was statistically weaker than other goaltenders in the league. This psychological effect is known as “the goalie factor” and it can be extremely powerful when leveraged correctly by teams facing playoff opponents who are unfamiliar with their opponents’ netminder. 

In order to take advantage of this effect, Holland needed a goaltender who could be streaky – someone who could go long stretches without allowing any goals but who could also blow up spectacularly at any moment (just like a roulette wheel). As luck would have it, Dominik Hask happened to be exactly that type of goaltender. And so began “the point of Dominik Hask” – which was not about his play between the pipes but rather about utilizing his unique goaltending style to tilt odds in Detroit’s favour when gambling on NHL games (and specifically playoff games).

#  Fans Wonder if NHL will ever Recover from Veto Replacement Roulette Disaster 
After the NHL's Board of Governors voted to veto the proposed expansion team in Seattle, many hockey fans are left wondering if the league will ever be able to recover.

The NHL has been expanding rapidly in recent years, with new teams popping up in places like Las Vegas and Winnipeg. But this latest move has left many fans feeling angry and betrayed. The Seattle ownership group, led by David Bonderman and Jerry Bruckheimer, had pledged to spend $650 million on a new arena, which would have created thousands of jobs and generated millions of dollars in revenue for the city.

In addition, the Seattle group had agreed to pay a $10 million relocation fee to the Arizona Coyotes, who would have been forced out of their current arena if the expansion team had been approved. But all of that was for nothing, as the Board of Governors decided to veto the proposal instead.

Many people are now wondering why the Board of Governors chose to veto the expansion team, especially when there are other cities like Quebec City and Hamilton that are also interested in having a NHL team. Some theories circulating on social media include: 

- The Board of Governors is afraid that an expansion team in Seattle would cannibalize revenue from other teams in the Western Conference 
- The Board of Governors is controlled by Quebec City interests who don't want another team in the West 
- The owners of existing teams don't want competition from a new team in Seattle 

Whatever the reason may be, it's clear that the decision has left a lot of people angry and frustrated. Hockey fans are already dealing with rising ticket prices and now they're being told that their city isn't worthy of having a NHL team after all. This is definitely not going to help attract new fans to the game.

The NHL has always been plagued by politics and backroom deals, but this latest debacle may be its final straw. The league needs to find a way to start putting its fans first if it wants to survive.

#  Hockey Nightmare: Veto Replacement Roulette Ruins Season 

The NHL offseason is always exciting, with teams making blockbuster moves in the hopes of contending for the Stanley Cup. However, this offseason has been especially frustrating for hockey fans, as the league's biggest star, Connor McDavid, remains without a contract extension.

But the drama didn't end there. On September 8th, the NHL announced that they had vetoed the proposed trade between the Ottawa Senators and Nashville Predators that would have sent defenseman P.K. Subban to Ottawa in exchange for forwards Matt Duchene and Kyle Turris.

The media went into a frenzy, with many pundits questioning why the league would block a trade that would seemingly benefit all teams involved. The answer lies in Article 11.8(c) of the NHL's Collective Bargaining Agreement:

"No Trade or No Movement Clauses in player contracts shall be permitted."

This clause was put into place to prevent players from holding teams hostage by refusing to waive their no-trade or no-movement clauses. However, in this case, it seems to have had the opposite effect, as the league has been forced to veto a trade because one team couldn't agree on which players to include in the deal.

This debacle has left Senators fans seething, as they watch their team squander another season while their division rivals improve. Predators fans are also upset, as they were hopeful of landing Subban, one of the best defensemen in the league.

As for McDavid, he remains unsigned and may end up sitting out part of the season if a new CBA isn't reached soon. This entire situation is a nightmare for hockey fans and it's clear that something needs to change before next offseason happens.

#  Is NHL Ready for AnotherVeto Replacement Roulette Debacle?

The NHL just can't seem to stay out of the headlines for all the wrong reasons. After a season filled with debating whether or not to allow participation in the Olympics and then the Pittsburgh Penguins winning their second straight Stanley Cup, the league is now embroiled in another debacle.

This time, it revolves around Vegas Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury being left off of Team Canada's roster for the upcoming World Cup of Hockey. It was announced on Wednesday that Fleury was one of three goalies cut from the team, with Roberto Luongo and Carey Price taking the other two spots.

This news did not sit well with many in the hockey world, as Fleury is coming off of back-to-back Stanley Cup wins and is considered one of the best goalies in the world. His omission from the team has created a firestorm on social media, with many people wondering how he could be left off when players like Montreal Canadiens defenseman P.K. Subban were named to the team.

Fans and pundits alike are now asking whether or not this decision was made due to politics, as Subban is black and Fleury is white. This has led to some calling for a boycott of the tournament, which will begin on September 17th.

NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly addressed these allegations on Thursday, stating that race had nothing to do with Fleury's omission from Team Canada. He went on to say that "the decision was made based on merit and performance - end of story."

Despite Daly's assurances, many people are still not convinced that politics didn't play a role in this decision. This latest fiasco is just another black eye for the NHL, which seems to be constantly mired in controversy.
