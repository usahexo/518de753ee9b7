#  Why can't I make a bet on the Hornets using my iPhone?

If you're using an iPhone to try and place a bet on the Charlotte Hornets, you're out of luck. The NBA has blocked all in-app betting functionality as part of their ongoing efforts to prevent illegal sports betting.

This is just the latest development in the NBA's efforts to combat sports betting, which they see as a major threat to the integrity of the game. In a statement, the league said that "developing innovative technologies that provide fans with unique and safe ways to engage in basketball betting is critical to protecting the integrity of our sport."

The NBA has long been opposed to legalized sports betting, and this latest move is just another attempt to maintain their position. Sports gambling is currently illegal in most states, but there has been a push for legalization in recent years.

The NFL, NHL, and MLB are also opposed to legalized sports betting, but the NBA is by far the most outspoken opponent. This is likely due to the fact that basketball is by far the most popular sport in America for gambling purposes.

There is a lot of money at stake here, and the NBA doesn't want to see its integrity compromised. While there is no guarantee that legal sports betting would cause any problems, the league wants to err on the side of caution.

The NBA's actions have drawn criticism from some quarters. Some people argue that prohibiting in-app betting only encourages people to bet illegally. Others claim that the real reason for the NBA's opposition is financial – they don't want casinos and other gambling establishments taking away their business.

Regardless of why they're doing it, it's clear that the NBA is serious about combatting sports betting. They will continue to block in-app bets and work with lawmakers across the country to oppose legalization.

#  iPhone users left out of NBA betting action

iphone users are used to being left out of the loop. whether its not having the latest and greatest features or being able to use the product at all, the iphone has a history of not being the best option for users.

now, it seems that iphone users are once again left out in the cold when it comes to betting on the national basketball association. las vegas casinos do not offer any real-time betting options for those using an iphone or ipad.

while this may not seem like a big deal, it is certainly a hindrance for those looking to make some quick bets on games. since there is no in-game betting option, those with an iphone have to wait until after the game is over to find out how they did.

this is especially frustrating if you are someone who likes to make last minute bets or if you are waiting for the game to end so you can place your bet on the outcome.

the lack of in-game betting options for iphone and ipad users is just another example of how these devices are often left out of things that are available on other platforms. apple has been working hard to change this perception, but there is still a long way to go.

#  iPhone Charlotte Hornets bettors frustrated

The iPhone Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The franchise was established in 1988 as an expansion team. The team's home arena is the Spectrum Center. The team is owned by Michael Jordan, who acquired controlling interest in January 2010.

The Hornets have qualified for the playoffs six times and won one division title. However, they have never won an NBA championship or been to the NBA Finals. As of July 2019, Jeremy Lamb is the franchise's all-time leading scorer.

iPhone Charlotte Hornet bettors have had a frustrating season so far. The team has not been able to live up to expectations, and many fans are hoping for a change in management before the end of the season. With only a few games left until the playoffs start, it remains to be seen whether the Hornets will be able to turn their fortunes around.

#  Could Apple be blocking betting sites on iPhones?

The Guardian has reported that Apple is blocking betting sites on iPhones in the United Kingdom. The site has not been able to open any of the major UK betting sites, such as Bet365, William Hill, and Ladbrokes, while using an iPhone. This could be a sign that Apple is looking to crackdown on gambling in the United Kingdom.

Apple has not released a statement commenting on the matter. It is unclear if this is a temporary issue or if Apple plans to permanently block betting sites on iPhones in the United Kingdom.

This comes as the UK government is considering new regulations for online gambling. The government is concerned about how young people are being drawn into gambling and is looking for ways to protect them.

It's worth noting that Apple did recently launch its own gambling app in the United States. The app, called Steve Jobs' Poker, allows users to play poker against other players online. That app appears to be unaffected by the block on UK betting sites.

#  Are sports betting sites not working on iPhones in Charlotte?

Looking for a good sports betting site to use on your iPhone but having trouble finding one that works in Charlotte? You're not alone. A lot of people seem to be having this issue, as Sportbetting.ag is the only major sports betting site that seems to be accessible in the area.

Of course, there are other ways to place bets on sporting events, such as through local bookmakers or by using an offshore site. But if you're looking for convenience and easy access, Sportbetting.ag may be your best option at the moment.

The good news is that this issue doesn't seem to be limited to Charlotte – people in other parts of the country are also reporting problems with accessing sports betting sites on their iPhones. So it's possible that this is a problem with Apple's Safari browser rather than with any specific site.

If you're having trouble accessing Sportbetting.ag or any other sports betting site on your iPhone, one workaround is to try using another browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Alternatively, you could try using an Android device instead of an iPhone.

Hopefully this issue will get resolved soon and people in Charlotte will once again be able to access their favorite sports betting sites on their smartphones. In the meantime, those who live in Charlotte can still place bets by using an Android phone or by going through a local bookmaker.
