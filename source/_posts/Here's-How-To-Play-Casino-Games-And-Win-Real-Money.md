# Tip #1: Choose The Right Games

The first thing you need to do is choose the right games. Not all casino games are created equal - some games offer better odds than others. So before you start playing, do your research and find the games that offer the best odds.

# Tip #2: Play Online

Another thing you can do to increase your chances of winning is to play online. Online casinos tend to have better odds than brick-and-mortar casinos, so if you want to increase your chances of winning, playing online is a good idea.

# Tip #3: Use A Strategy

Another way to improve your chances of winning is to use a strategy. There are many different strategies out there, so be sure to do your research and find one that works for you.

You don't even have to memorize everything, just know the key things like when to hit or stay depending on your cards and those of the dealer! You might also want try a betting system like Labouchere which again WizardofOdds has a comprehensive guide on how this works if you’re interested in trying it out yourself! 
At its heart blackjack is a very simple game provided both player and dealer draw cards totalling 21 or less respectively without going bust - but therein lies where most players can gain an advantage over house edge by using optimal game play (knowing when hit etc) against what the dealer holds rather than blindly going by gut feeling or hunches like many players still currently do which generally speaking gives an overall 2-3% house edge over them - beating it in many cases! Roulette for instance despite being around since 17th century France offers some pretty terrible odds for players when bets are made outside of betting “en prison” & “surrender” explained later on however due these rules incorporated into gameplay Casino Royale offers single number bets at favourable odds of 37:1 when betting straight up opposed American roulette whereby bets placed on same numbers but with 2 green coloured 0 segments result in odds numbering 174:1. Craps meanwhile may appear daunting & confusing at first however layout comprises just 2 rows & 4 columns meaning understanding quickly what bets can be made isn’t actually that tricky with practice whilst main combinations result in 3:1 payouts respectively most notably “Pass Line” bet coupled with taking Odds bet For further reading on game types/strategies etc then we suggest heading over WizardofOdds who as well as detailed guides also offers handy little calculators allowing users determine house edge % along with other important metrics dependant game played - we certainly wouldn’t want anyone feeling daunted!
