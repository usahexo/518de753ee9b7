#  What are the benefits of running? 

There are many benefits of running. Running has been shown to improve mental health, increase lifespan, and reduce the risk of diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

Mental Health:

Running has been shown to improve mental health. A study published in "Psychology of Sport and Exercise" found that runners had lower levels of depression and anxiety than people who did not run. In another study, published in "The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness," researchers studied the effects of running on mental health and found that running was associated with reduced anxiety, less stress, and improved mood.

Longevity:

Several studies have shown that running can increase lifespan. One study, published in "The Lancet," followed participants for over 20 years and found that those who ran had a longer lifespan than those who did not run. Another study, published in "Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes," found that runners were 23% less likely to die during the study period than non-runners. And a study published in "JAMA Internal Medicine" found that people who ran at least 5 times per week were 29% less likely to die during the study period than those who didn't run at all.

Heart Disease:

Running has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease. A study published in "Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise" found that runners had a lower risk of death from heart disease than non-runners. In another study,published in "The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition," researchers looked at the effects of running on heart disease risk factors and found that runners had lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels than non-runners.

#  What are the best times to run? 

There is no one "best time" to run. Some runners prefer to run first thing in the morning, before the day gets hectic and they have other obligations. This can be a good way to start your day and get your metabolism going. 

Other runners prefer to run later in the day, after work or school. This can be a great way to end the day and relieve stress. Running also releases endorphins, which can make you feel happy and relaxed. 

The best time to run really depends on what works best for you personally. If you're not a morning person, don't try to force yourself to run early in the morning. Try running later in the day and see how that works for you. 

Ultimately, it's important to find a time when you can be consistent with your running. If you only run once a week, it's probably not worth trying to switch your schedule around just for running. Try finding a time that fits into your current routine and stick with it. You'll start seeing results over time!

#  What are the worst times to run? 

There is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on the individual. However, there are some general times when running is not recommended.

One of the worst times to run is when you are feeling sick. If you have a cold or the flu, running can actually make you feel worse. Exercising during these illnesses can cause your body to work harder and produce more toxins than it can handle. Additionally, running may aggravate your symptoms and make you feel even sicker.

Additionally, running is not recommended for people who are pregnant or nursing. During pregnancy, the body undergoes many changes, and running can be strenuous and put unnecessary strain on the body. Nursing mothers also need to be careful not to over exert themselves, as it can impact their milk supply.

Another time when running is not recommended is immediately after eating. When you eat, your body’s digestive system is working hard to break down food and absorb the nutrients. Running right after eating can cause discomfort and stomach problems. It’s best to wait at least an hour after eating before hitting the pavement.

Finally, running at high altitudes can be dangerous for some people. If you are not used to high altitudes, running at elevation can cause dizziness, shortness of breath and other health problems. If you plan on traveling to a location with high altitudes, be sure to take into account how this will affect your ability to run safely.

#  What can you do to stay motivated to run?

A lot of people find running to be a great way to stay in shape, but not everyone enjoys running. So how can you stay motivated to run when it's not your favorite activity? Here are some tips:

1. Find a friend or group to run with. This can make the experience more enjoyable and help you stay accountable.

2. Make a plan. If you have races or goals lined up, it can give you something to work towards and keep you motivated.

3. Set some small goals along the way. Instead of aiming for a certain distance or time, focus on things like running for a certain number of days in a row or increasing your speed gradually over time.

4. Get creative with your routes. If you're getting bored with the same old scenery, try exploring new areas or mix up your route regularly.

5. Run for a cause. There are plenty of charities that allow runners to fundraise for their cause, which can give you extra motivation to lace up your sneakers.

6. Reward yourself after runs. Maybe treat yourself to a new piece of gear once you've hit a milestone distance or buy yourself a healthy snack after completing a tough workout session.

7. Take care of your body. Make sure you're fueling properly before and after runs, getting enough sleep, and stretching out properly afterward too!
