#  Is it legal to play at online casinos in Moldova? 

Moldova is a small country in eastern Europe, sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine. It’s a relatively new country, formed in 1991 when the Soviet Union broke up.

Moldova has been an independent country for over 25 years, and during that time it has developed into a modern, democratic nation. But while Moldova may be a thriving democracy, it is still something of a Wild West when it comes to gambling laws.

This is because the gambling laws in Moldova are quite complex, and they haven’t been fully updated since the country became independent. So while some forms of gambling are technically illegal in Moldova, there is no clear way to enforce these laws.

As a result, there is a thriving online casino industry in Moldova. In fact, there are more online casinos operating from Moldova than any other country in Europe. This is because the lack of clear gambling laws means that casino operators can set up shop without any fear of legal retribution.
