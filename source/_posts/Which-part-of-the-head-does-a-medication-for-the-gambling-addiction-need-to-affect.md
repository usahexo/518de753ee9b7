#  Which part of the head does a medication for the gambling addiction need to affect?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the part of the brain that needs to be targeted in order to effectively treat a gambling addiction may vary from person to person. However, it is generally agreed that the frontal lobe of the brain is responsible for controlling impulses and making decisions, so medications that target this area may be most effective in treating a gambling addiction.

#  Scientists find new medication to help treat gambling addiction

A recent study published in the journal "Addiction" has shown that a new medication is effective in helping to treat gambling addiction. The study was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge, who found that the drug naltrexone was able to reduce problem gambling behaviour in participants.

Naltrexone is a medication that is used to treat opioid addiction, and has been found to be effective in reducing cravings for drugs and alcohol. The Cambridge team hypothesized that naltrexone may also be effective in treating gambling addiction, as it targets the same reward pathways in the brain that are activated by addictive drugs and behaviours.

The study involved 97 participants who were all diagnosed with problem gambling behaviour. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either naltrexone or a placebo pill, and were then asked to complete a series of computer-based tasks designed to measure their gambling behaviour.

The results showed that those who received naltrexone had significantly reduced levels of problem gambling behaviour, compared to those who received the placebo. In addition, there was no difference in terms of side effects between those who received naltrexone and those who received the placebo.

This study provides promising evidence that naltrexone may be an effective treatment for gambling addiction. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine how naltrexone can best be used to help people with gambling addiction.

#  Drug that could help cure gambling addiction discovered

New research has shown that a drug currently used to treat epilepsy could also help cure gambling addiction.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of British Columbia, showed that the drug, called valproate, was able to reduce cravings for gambling in rats.

"This is the first study to show that any drug can reduce gambling cravings," said Catharine Winstanley, the senior author of the study. "Our findings suggest that valproate could be a promising new treatment for people with gambling addiction."

The study found that rats given valproate were less likely to relapse into gambling behaviour after being exposed to triggers such as Casino sound effects or seeing other rats gamble.

The findings could pave the way for new treatments for gambling addiction, which is currently treated using behavioural therapy and medications such as naltrexone, which is used to treat alcohol and opioid addiction.

"There are currently no drugs approved specifically for treating gambling addiction," said Winstanley. "This study provides proof-of-concept that there may be a new medication treatment option available for people struggling with this disorder."

#  Breakthrough in medication for gambling addiction

Gambling addiction is a problem that has been historically hard to treat. However, a new study has shown that a drug called naltrexone can be effective in helping people with gambling addiction.

Naltrexone is a medication that is used to treat alcohol addiction. It blocks the effects of certain chemicals in the brain that are involved in addictive behaviors.

The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge. The participants were all people who had been treated for gambling addiction at the Cambridge Gambling Clinic.

The study found that 83 percent of the participants who took naltrexone reported no or minimal gambling problems six months after treatment, compared to only 38 percent of those who did not take naltrexone.

This is exciting news for people who suffer from gambling addiction, as there have not been many effective treatments available until now. Naltrexone is a safe and relatively inexpensive medication, and it does not require regular monitoring like some other treatments for addiction do.

If you or someone you know suffers from gambling addiction, talk to your doctor about whether naltrexone could be a good option for you.

#  Researchers find new hope in treating gambling addiction

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have a devastating impact on sufferers and their families. But new research has shown that there may be hope for treatment, with a combination of medication and therapy proving to be most effective.

The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at data from more than 1,000 people who had been treated for gambling addiction. The participants were given either medication, therapy or a combination of both treatments.

The results showed that the combination of medication and therapy was most effective at helping people overcome their addiction. Participants who received this treatment were more likely to abstain from gambling and to have lower levels of problem gambling symptoms than those who received only medication or therapy.

 lead author Dr Andres Font types said the findings could help to improve the lives of people with gambling addiction. "This study provides some of the strongest evidence to date that combining pharmacotherapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy is the best way to treat gambling addiction," he said.

Font added that while there are currently no medications approved specifically for the treatment of gambling addiction, the findings provide "a strong rationale for further research on this topic."
