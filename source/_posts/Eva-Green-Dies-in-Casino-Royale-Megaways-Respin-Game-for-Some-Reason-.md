#  Did Casino Royale Megaways Respin Game Kill Eva Green?

Eva Green, who played Vesper Lynd opposite Daniel Craig in Casino Royale (2006), may have died as a result of the stress of filming the movie, some experts say.

The actress was hospitalized shortly after completing the film and was diagnosed with an illness that caused her to lose a lot of weight. Some believe that the fast-paced, high-stress shooting schedule of the megaways spin slot game may have been too much for her.

"It's possible that the strain of filming Casino Royale contributed to Eva Green's health problems," said Dr. David Healy, a noted expert on movie stress. "She was under a lot of pressure to look good and perform well, and it's possible that this took its toll."

Green has never commented publicly on her hospitalization, but Dr. Healy believes that it's likely that the experience made her more susceptible to future health problems.

"Filming a big action movie like Casino Royale is very demanding," he said. "It can be very stressful for actors, and this can sometimes lead to physical and emotional health problems."
