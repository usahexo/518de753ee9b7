#  Majority of Americans Approve Gambling Casinos!

A recent study has shown that the majority of Americans now approve of casino gambling! The study, conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that 58 percent of Americans surveyed said they approved of casino gambling, while 39 percent disapproved. This is a large change from 2006, when only 44 percent of Americans approved of casino gambling.

The study also showed that there are vast differences in approval rates based on political party affiliation. For example, 83 percent of Republicans surveyed approved of casino gambling, while only 33 percent of Democrats felt the same way. Interestingly, approval rates were about the same among both those who identified as very liberal and very conservative – 54 percent and 55 percent, respectively.

There are many reasons why Americans’ attitudes towards casino gambling have shifted over the past decade. Some believe that it is simply because more people have had experience with casinos – either through traveling or through family and friends who visit them. Others say that it’s because the economy has been struggling in recent years, and people are looking for ways to make money.

Whatever the reason may be, the fact remains that casino gambling is now more popular than ever before in America!

#  60% of Population Approves Gambling Casinos 
In spite of the controversies that have long swirled around gambling and casinos, they continue to grow in popularity. According to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey, 60% of Likely U.S. Voters say they at least somewhat approve of legalized gambling casinos. That’s up from 52% in March of last year and is the highest level of approval measured for this question since December 2007

Only 33% now oppose casino gambling, down from 42% in 2017. And six percent (6%) are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.) 
The findings come as two states – Michigan and Illinois – prepare to vote on legalizing casino gambling in November. If approved, those states would join 24 other jurisdictions where casino gambling is already legal.

Gambling has been around for centuries, with different forms of it enjoyed in almost every culture around the world. The first known casino was established in Venice, Italy in 1638. Americans began betting on horse races shortly after the Revolutionary War and lotteries were introduced as a way to finance civic improvements beginning in the 1790s. 
Casino gambling didn’t become widespread until after World War II when Las Vegas began to attract gamblers from all over the country with its neon lights and gaming tables. In the decades since, casinos have popped up all over the U.S., with Macau and Singapore becoming leading destinations for high-stakes gamblers from around the globe.

While opinions about gambling vary, there is little doubt that it is big business. The global gaming industry is worth an estimated $450 billion per year, according to gaming research firm H2 Gambling Capital. Las Vegas alone generates more than $6 billion in gaming revenue each year. 

Opposition to casinos often comes from those who believe that they are a form of legalized theft because they prey on people who are addicted to gambling or who are already struggling financially. But proponents argue that most people can gamble responsibly and that casinos provide jobs and generate tax revenue for local communities. 

The increasing acceptance of casino gambling may be due, in part, to the fact that American attitudes about gambling have been changing over time. A Gallup poll taken in 1971 showed that only 26% of Americans favored legalizing casino gambling nationwide while 63% opposed it. But by 2013, support had grown to 54%, with opposition dropping to 41%.

#  Majority of Americans Support Gambling Casinos 

A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found that a majority of Americans support the legalization of gambling casinos. The poll was conducted from July 19th to the 23rd and involved 1,058 adults. According to the results, 52 percent of Americans support the legalization of gambling casinos, while 43 percent oppose it. Five percent said they did not know or declined to answer.

The poll also found that there is partisan divide on the issue; 65 percent of Democrats support legalization, while only 33 percent of Republicans do. Independents were evenly split, with 50 percent supporting and 50 percent opposing legalization. Age was also a major factor in views on gambling casinos; those 18 to 29 were more likely to support it (64 percent) than those 60 and older (41 percent).

Support for legalizing gambling casinos has grown in recent years. In 2013, a CBS News poll found that 47 percent of Americans supported it, while 48 percent opposed it.

Opposition to gambling casinos is largely based on the belief that they would lead to more crime and corruption. However, research has shown that this is not always the case. A study by the Institute for American Values looked at casino locations in eight states and found that “casinos are neither magnets for crime nor harbingers of social pathology”. In fact, many communities actually see an increase in economic activity after a casino opens.

The issue of legalizing gambling casinos is sure to continue to be debated in America. Those who support it argue that it would be a boon to the economy, while those who oppose it argue that it would lead to more crime and corruption. Only time will tell which side will prevail.

#  60% of Americans support gambling casinos 

Casino gambling is a popular form of entertainment in the United States. A recent Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans support casinos.

Americans enjoy gambling for a variety of reasons. Some people view it as a way to make money, while others simply enjoy the excitement and distraction it provides.

Casinos can be found in many states, including Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. They generate billions of dollars in revenue each year and support thousands of jobs.

The industry has come under fire in recent years, however, as some people have argued that it harms society overall. Critics say that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial problems for individuals and families.

Supporters of casinos argue that the benefits outweigh the risks. They say that casinos provide jobs and revenue for local communities, and that they are a safe and entertaining way to spend time.

The debate over casino gambling will likely continue, but it appears that most Americans favor it at this point.

#  Over Half of Americans Approve Gambling Casinos

A recent Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans approve of gambling casinos, while 43% disapprove. This is a reversal from 2007 when 58% of Americans disapproved of casinos.

The poll also found that there is a partisan divide on the issue: 79% of Republicans approve of gambling casinos, while only 38% of Democrats do. Independents are about evenly split, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving.

There are a number of reasons for the change in opinion. Casinos are now seen as a source of revenue for states, since they pay out millions in taxes. They also create jobs, both in the casino itself and in the industries that support it. And finally, many people believe that casinos are just a form of entertainment and that they can't lose if they don't gamble.

Opposition to gambling casinos has traditionally come from those who believe that they lead to addiction and crime. But with more than half of Americans now supporting them, it seems that opposition is waning.
